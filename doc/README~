Welcome to the LJMU Staff Holiday Requests System.

This system offers a complete system to fullfil your Holiday Request needs.

If you already have a Username & Password then you can just Log in to the system. However don't worry if you don't as the system also allows you to register.

Once you have logged in, you can view your existing holiday requests, edit them if you require and also delete them if you don't require them anymore.
You can also view other staff members holiday requests however you will not be able to edit or delete them.

The system currently has a number of test users and the Usernames and Passwords for each user can be found below:

Username:           Password:

enrtelsw            test
enrlrob             test1
enrashim            test123
enrlstro            test
enrjpfin            test123
admin               admin123

The passwords are purely for Test purposes and would obviously be changed for the Finalised system.

The Admin user account allows the admin to be able to edit, delete and authorise other people's staff holiday's however the ability to create a new holiday is restricted to just the normal users.

The UI of the System needs to be improved however all of the basic functionality has been implemented.
